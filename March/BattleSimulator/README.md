# Battle For The Country

## Project Description
---
This is Battle For The Country, a turn-based battle game where you create custom characters and have them fight in turn-based battles. Characters can save inbetween runs of the game and they can level up, allowing them to achieve higher stats. This serves as a spin-off from my previous game, Quest For The Country. It is recommended to play this game with two players.
